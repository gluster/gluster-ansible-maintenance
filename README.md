Role Name
=========

replace_node - Replace gluster node with a new node.

Requirements
------------

- Ansible >= 2.6
- lvm2 (Optional)


NOTE: Inventory should contain a single node, which should be part of the cluster. This node should be different than any of the three variables explained below, this requirement is to collect the right peers for the new node.

Role Variables
--------------

| Name                     | Required? | Choices| Default value         | Comments                          |
|--------------------------|----|---|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| gluster_maintenance_old_node | Yes |  | UNDEF   | The node which has to be replaced with a new node. Just the node name is needed to get the peer id, the node need not be accessible. Provide the name that was used to probe the peers. |
| gluster_maintenance_new_node | Yes|  | UNDEF | New node which will replace the old node. This name can be same as the old node or different name. |
| gluster_maintenance_cluster_node | Yes | | UNDEF | The node on which the peer, volume-id details are collected. This node should be part of the trusted storage pool, and different from node being replaced.|
| gluster_maintenance_ovirt_url |  No| | UNDEF | URL for the ovirt management node |
| gluster_maintenance_ovirt_username | No | | UNDEF | Username for ovirt management node authentication |
| gluster_maintenance_ovirt_password | No | | UNDEF | Password for ovirt management node login. This variable has to be encrypted using ansible-vault. |
| gluster_maintenance_ovirt_cafile | No | | UNDEF | A PEM file containing the trusted CA certificates. The certificate presented by the server will be verified using these CA certificates. |

Dependencies
------------

Depends on:

- gluster.repositories (Optional: to subscribe to channels)
- gluster.infra (Optional: to setup bricks)

Example Playbook
----------------

Note that `server' in the inventory and the variable gluster_maintenance_cluster_node are unique (if the number of nodes are more than 2).

```
---
- remote_user: root
  gather_facts: no
  hosts: server
  no_log: True
  vars:
    - gluster_maintenance_old_node: host1.example.com
    - gluster_maintenance_new_node: host1.example.com
    - gluster_maintenance_cluster_node: host2.example.com
    - gluster_maintenance_cluster_node_2: host2.example.com

  roles:
    - gluster.maintenance
```

In the above example, a new host named host1.example.com will replace the old host (the replaced node has the same hostname as the old node, however ensure that old node is not accessible with the hostname, else the results are undefined.
